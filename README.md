### <strong>Employee User Stories:</strong>

<strong>Frank-</strong> 
As Frank, a support worker looking for easier access to forms, I want to be able to write and submit incident reports throughout my shift, so that I can write them while they are still fresh in my mind.

<strong>Rosa-</strong> 
 As Rosa, a young support worker looking to streamline the handover process, I want to have quick and easy access to handover notes, so that I can avoid any downtime when my shift starts.

<strong>Grace-</strong> 
As Grace, a support worker that likes to take her clients to do new activities, I want to be able to review historical shift notes so that I can keep my clients doing activities that werenâ€™t done in the days leading up to my shift.

As John, a parent who employs carers for an adult son with care needs, I want a way to store all shift notes and incident reports produced by care workers electronically so that I can easily review and retrieve them by date.

<strong>Ellen-</strong> 
As Ellen, the lead support worker for a small team of carers, I would love a place to schedule myself and teammates for care shifts and view a calendar of upcoming shifts so that we can all have a central place to view our roster and avoid miscommunication.

<strong>Sandra-</strong> 
As Sandra, the care coordinator for a small business that assigns carers for many patients, I need a single app that I can use to keep track of all carers assigned to our patients so that I can better manage scheduling.
